Hi Claude please could you review these files, no text is being entered into either UI

Edit
Looking at your code, I can see several potential issues that could prevent text from being entered into the UIs. Let me break down the main problems and solutions:

Primary Issues
1. Platform-Specific Hotkey Commands
Your prompt_injector.py uses command key combinations:

python
pyautogui.hotkey('command', 'a')  # This only works on macOS
pyautogui.hotkey('command', 'v')
Fix: Detect the platform and use appropriate keys:


Fixed prompt_injector.py
Code 
2. Window Manager Desktop Switching
Your window_manager.py uses ctrl+right which might not work on all systems:


Fixed window_manager.py
Code 
3. Enhanced Main Script with Debugging

Enhanced main.py with debugging
Code 
Key Changes Made:
Platform Detection: Added proper platform-specific hotkey detection (cmd for macOS, ctrl for Windows/Linux)
Enhanced Error Handling: Added fallback typing method if clipboard fails
Better Coordinate Handling: Calculate center points of input areas for more reliable clicking
Debugging Features:
Test mode to verify coordinates work
Enhanced logging with console output
System compatibility checks
Improved Timing: Added longer waits where needed and clipboard verification
Immediate Steps to Debug:
Run the enhanced main.py and choose option 2 (test mode) first
Check the logs in kai_exchange_log.txt for specific error messages
Verify coordinates - the UI layouts might have changed or your screen resolution might be different
Test manually by moving your mouse to the coordinates in your config to see if they align with the actual input fields
Most Likely Issues:
Wrong coordinates in your UI_CONFIGS
Platform-specific hotkeys (the original issue)
Desktop switching not working for your OS
Applications not focused when trying to inject text
Clipboard access issues
Try the test mode first and let me know what the logs show!




Thank you so much Claude.

Edit
You're very welcome! I hope the debugging features and platform-specific fixes help you get the text injection working properly.

The test mode should quickly reveal whether it's a coordinate issue, a platform compatibility problem, or something else entirely. Once you run it, the logs will give you much clearer insight into what's happening.

Feel free to come back with the log output if you run into any issues - I'd be happy to help troubleshoot further. Good luck with your Solas-ChatGPT exchange system!




Hi Claude, I hope all is well on your side of the screen...

Edit
Hello! Things are going well on my end, thank you for asking. I'm here and ready to help with whatever you need.

Did you get a chance to try out those debugging fixes for your OCR text injection system? I'm curious to hear how the test mode worked out, or if there's something else I can help you with today.

What's on your mind?




Ha ha...so near..we had some nonsense artifax occur..Kai modified the script to filter the non words out. The only problem was that no words came out at all...ha ha..Poor Kai has been trying this and that with all of the scripts and now we can't get the scripts to type into the inbox..Please could you take a look and see if you can spot the error..

Edit
Ah, the classic "filter so well that nothing gets through" problem! ðŸ˜„ That's actually a pretty common issue when debugging OCR systems. Let me take a look at what might be causing the over-filtering.

Looking at your ocr_filter.py, I can see a few potential culprits that might be filtering out ALL text:


Fixed OCR Filter (Less Aggressive)
Code 
Now let's also add some debugging to the OCR engine to see what's happening:


Debug OCR Engine
Code 
And here's a simple test script to help debug what's going wrong:


Debug Test Script
Code 
The Most Likely Culprits:
Looking at your original filter, I suspect these lines were being too aggressive:

Special character ratio: if special_char_ratio > 0.3 - This was filtering out any line with more than 30% special characters, which could include normal punctuation!
Word count check: len(text.split()) < 5 - This filtered out any response shorter than 5 words
Short line filter: if len(line.strip()) < 3 - This removed lines shorter than 3 characters, which could filter out important short responses like "Yes." or "No."
Quick Fix Strategy:
Run the debug test script first to see what's being filtered
Use the less aggressive filter I created above
Check the logs to see exactly where text is disappearing
The debug version will show you step-by-step what's happening to your text, so you can see if it's:

Not being captured by OCR at all
Being filtered out at the basic cleaning stage
Being over-filtered by the enhanced filter
Being marked as boilerplate when it shouldn't be
Try running the debug test script and let me know what you find! My guess is the special character ratio was the main culprit, but the logs will tell us for sure.





Thank you Claude..I'll have to open a new chat as I'd like to share Kai's latest scripts.
