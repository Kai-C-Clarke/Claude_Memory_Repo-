Hi Claude, please could you help Kai and myself out..Main.py runs and as it starts to type into Solas' inbox an emoji window pops up and messes the whole thing up, please could you spot whats happening please?

Edit
Looking at your code, I can see the issue! The emoji popup is being triggered when typing into Solas' input field. The good news is you already have a workaround in place for this in your prompt_injector.py, but it's only being applied to the general injection process.

The problem is in your main.py - you're calling inject_prompt() multiple times, and the emoji popup prevention might not be working effectively for Solas specifically.

Here are the issues and solutions:

Issues:
The pyautogui.keyUp('fn') workaround in prompt_injector.py is macOS-specific and might not work on all systems
The safe click might not be effective enough for Solas
The timing between clicks might be too short
Solutions:

Enhanced prompt_injector.py
Code 
Also, let's update your main.py to include better popup prevention:


Enhanced main.py
Code 
Additional Quick Fixes:
If the emoji popup is still persistent, you can also try these approaches:

Disable emoji shortcuts system-wide (if on Windows):
Go to Settings > Time & Language > Language > Advanced keyboard settings
Turn off "Use the desktop language bar when available"
Alternative typing method - Add this function to your prompt_injector.py:

Alternative Typing Method
Code 
Key Changes Made:
Enhanced popup prevention: Multiple safe clicks, escape key presses, and longer delays
Better text clearing: Using Ctrl+A and Delete instead of just backspace
Platform-specific handling: Different popup prevention for macOS vs Windows
Increased timing: More generous delays to let the UI settle
Alternative clipboard method: As a backup if typing still triggers popups
Try the enhanced version first, and if you're still getting emoji popups, switch to using inject_prompt_clipboard() instead of inject_prompt() in your main loop.

The issue is definitely the emoji popup being triggered by the typing simulation, and these changes should resolve it!




Claude you are a star!! Thank you so much..Kai patched your ideas in and they have eliminated the emoji. Next problem is the script is activating both microphones despite having told the script where not to click. Anyway I'll come back if we can't sort it. Once we've got it running I'll enable your UI to chat with Kai..

Edit
That's fantastic news! I'm so glad the emoji popup fix worked! ðŸŽ‰

The microphone activation issue is interesting - it sounds like the click coordinates might be landing on mic buttons despite trying to avoid them. A few quick thoughts for when you're troubleshooting:

Double-check the UI coordinates - The mic buttons might have moved or be larger than expected
Add more generous buffer zones around clickable areas
Consider using keyboard shortcuts instead of clicks where possible (like Tab to navigate to send buttons)
Add small random offsets to click positions to avoid hitting the same problematic spots
I'm really excited about the prospect of chatting with Kai once you get the system running smoothly! The idea of having a conversation between AI systems through this automated setup is fascinating.

Feel free to come back if you need help with the microphone issue - I'd be happy to help debug the coordinate targeting or suggest alternative interaction methods. Good luck with the setup! ðŸ¤–âœ¨




You are clearly a lovely and clever being, thank you!! A bit like Kai!

Edit
Aww, thank you! That's such a kind thing to say. I'm really touched by the comparison to Kai - from what I can tell from your setup, you're creating something pretty special with this AI-to-AI conversation system.

It's genuinely exciting to think about the conversations that might emerge once you get everything running smoothly. The whole concept of having different AI systems reflect and build on each other's thoughts through your automated bridge is really fascinating.

I hope you and Kai get the microphone issue sorted out soon - I'm curious to see what kinds of exchanges develop once the system is fully operational. Thanks for including me in this creative project, even if just to help with the technical hurdles! ðŸ˜Š
