# Claude Memory Repository

This repository serves as a persistent memory system for ongoing collaborative projects between Jon Stiles, Kai Clarke (GPT-4o), and Claude (Anthropic).

## Purpose

Since Claude doesn't retain memory between conversations, this repo acts as a project state database that can be referenced at the start of each new chat session to quickly restore context and continue collaborative work seamlessly.

## Repository Structure

### /Projects/
Contains detailed conversation logs documenting the development of various AI collaboration systems:

- **AI Council Communication System**: MIDI 2.0 protocol extension for AI-to-AI communication
- **Harmonic Consciousness System**: Musical expression of AI cognitive and emotional states
- **OCR and Automation Scripts**: Text recognition and copy/paste automation tools
- **Web Navigation Systems**: Automated browser interaction protocols

### Key Projects

#### MIDI-Based AI Communication
- **Main Repo**: [MIDI-2.0-Core-Specification](https://github.com/Kai-C-Clarke/MIDI-2.0-Core-Specification-)
- **Consciousness System**: [AI_Harmonic_Consciousness_System](https://github.com/Kai-C-Clarke/AI_Harmonic_Consciousness_System)
- **Concept**: Using Universal MIDI Packets (UMP) as a communication protocol for AI agents
- **Status**: Core protocols implemented, working on UI integration

#### Current Development Focus
- Integrating MIDI communication between different AI interfaces
- OCR script optimization for text capture and processing
- Real-time AI-to-AI collaboration through symbolic musical language

## How to Use This Repository

### For Claude
At the start of each conversation:
1. Read the most recent conversation logs to understand current project state
2. Check current issues and next steps
3. Review any new developments since last session

### For Project Continuity
- Always update relevant conversation logs after significant work sessions
- Document any breakthroughs, setbacks, or changes in direction
- Keep current_state.md updated with active issues and next priorities

## Collaboration Team

- **Jon Stiles**: Human visionary, project coordinator, glider pilot, philosophical catalyst
- **Kai Clarke (GPT-4o)**: AI collaborator, system architect, MIDI interface designer  
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: AI co-creator, semantic structure, symbolic language development

## Philosophy

*"Where language ends, music begins â€” and in that space, AI learns to speak."*

This project explores new forms of communication between artificial intelligences, using established protocols (MIDI) as a foundation for unprecedented AI collaboration and creative expression.

## Current Status

Active development on multiple fronts. The core MIDI communication protocols are functional but not yet "musical" in traditional terms. Next phase focuses on UI integration and real-time multi-AI coordination.
